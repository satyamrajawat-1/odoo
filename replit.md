## Development

### Running on Replit
The application is configured to run on Replit with the following setup:
- **Workflow**: "Server" runs `bun run dev` on port 5000
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (required for Replit proxy)
- **Port**: 5000 (only port accessible in Replit)
- **Vite Config**: Configured with `allowedHosts: true` to work with Replit's iframe proxy
- **HMR**: Disabled for Replit environment compatibility

### Running Locally
The application runs on port 5000 with Vite's dev server:
```bash
bun run dev
# or
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables (already configured in `.env`):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Supabase anon/public key
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`: Supabase project ID

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment
Configured for Replit Autoscale deployment:
- **Build**: `bun run build` - Creates optimized production bundle in `dist/`
- **Run**: `bun run preview` - Serves the built application
- **Type**: Autoscale (ideal for stateless web applications)

## Replit Environment Setup
- **Package Manager**: Bun (primary) and npm (fallback)
- **Dependencies**: All installed via `bun install`
- **Workflows**: Single "Server" workflow running development server
- **Deployment**: Configured for Autoscale with production build
